# [Kimi K3, and what we can still learn from the pelican benchmark](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jul/16/kimi-k3/)

Kimi K3 represents a massive scale-up in parameters (2.8T), competing directly with the top-tier frontier models.

## Key Points
- Moonshot AI released Kimi K3, a 2.8 trillion parameter model, described as the first "open 3T-class model" with an open weight release promised by July 27, 2026.
- Benchmarks indicate K3 generally outperforms [[tech/claude-opus-4.8|Claude Opus 4.8]] and [[tech/gpt-5.5|GPT-5.5]], but trails [[tech/claude-fable-5|Claude Fable 5]] and [[tech/gpt-5.6|GPT-5.6]].
- Kimi K3 is currently the leading model on Arena.ai’s Frontend Code arena, surpassing [[tech/claude-fable-5|Claude Fable 5]].
- Pricing has increased significantly to $3/million input and $15/million output tokens, aligning it with the [[tech/claude-sonnet|Claude Sonnet]] series and making it the most expensive model from a Chinese AI lab to date.
- The "pelican benchmark" (generating an SVG of a pelican on a bicycle) reveals high reasoning overhead, with K3 consuming 13,241 reasoning tokens for a single task.
- Analysis of token counts suggests Kimi K3 may utilize a hidden system prompt of approximately 85 tokens.
- [AI Synthesis] The shift toward premium pricing suggests Moonshot AI is pivoting from a growth-at-all-costs user acquisition strategy to a value-capture model targeting high-end enterprise and developer workloads.
