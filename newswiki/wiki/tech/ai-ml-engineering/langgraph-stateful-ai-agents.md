# [LangGraph: Build Stateful AI Agents in Python](https://realpython.com/langgraph-python/)

LangGraph provides a powerful, visualizable framework (StateGraph) for modeling complex, real-world [[hubs/llm|LLM]] applications that require memory, decision-making, and iteration.

## LangGraph Fundamentals
- LangGraph builds upon LangChain to enable sophisticated [[hubs/llm|LLM]] workflows capable of handling real-world complexities like state, conditional edges, and cycles.
- Key concepts include defining workflows using state graphs composed of nodes (actions) and edges (transitions).
- The library allows for the construction of autonomous [[hubs/llm|LLM]] agents that process tasks using state graphs to interact with external tools or APIs.

## Core Components & Concepts
- **Nodes**: Represent discrete actions within the graph (e.g., calling a function, invoking a chain).
- **Edges**: Define the flow control, dictating which node executes next based on the current state.
- **State**: A shared, mutable data structure (`GraphState`) passed between nodes, holding all necessary context for the workflow.
- **Advanced Flows**: Advanced patterns like conditional edges and cycles allow for complex, decision-driven workflows, moving beyond simple linear chains.

## Advanced Workflow Patterns
- **Conditional Edges**: Allow the graph to dynamically choose the next path based on the current state (e.g., `route_escalation_status_edge`).
- **Cycles**: Enable loops between nodes, allowing the graph to iterate on a task until a terminal condition is met (e.g., answering follow-up questions until all are resolved).
- **Agent Architecture**: LangGraph is well-suited for building agents where an [[hubs/llm|LLM]] acts as the decision-maker, and external tools are executed based on the agent's instructions.
