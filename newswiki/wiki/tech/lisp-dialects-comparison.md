# [A Road to Lisp: Which Lisp](https://scotto.me/blog/2026-07-17-which-lisp/)

Clojure is recommended for most developers due to its modern syntax, strong tooling, and production use in major tech companies.

## Key Points
- Lisp is a family of programming languages, not a single language, with over 20 dialects due to shared syntax and divergent semantics.
- [AI Synthesis] Common Lisp (CL) is the most mature and standardized dialect, with ANSI specification from 1994; supports native compilation, powerful REPL, and advanced features like condition and restart system.
- [AI Synthesis] Clojure runs on the JVM, offers functional programming with immutable data, and provides seamless integration with Java ecosystems; used by Nubank, Walmart, Netflix, and Apple.
- [AI Synthesis] Racket is language-oriented, enabling creation of new programming languages and DSLs; ideal for education, research, and prototyping with built-in GUI and development tools.
- [AI Synthesis] Elisp is used for customizing Emacs, offering real-time editor extension without reload.

## Dialect Highlights
- [[tech/common-lisp|Common Lisp]] excels in performance and long-running processes, with native compilation and powerful debugging via live REPL.
- [[tech/clojure|Clojure]] shines in data-intensive systems and large-scale software, with immutable data, lazy sequences, and seamless JVM integration.
- [[tech/racket|Racket]] is ideal for language design, compiler development, and educational tools, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and a beginner-friendly IDE.
- [[tech/elisp|Elisp]] enables deep customization of Emacs, making it a practical tool for developers who rely on the editor for daily workflows.

## Syntax and Use Cases
- Common Lisp uses `LOOP` and `CASE` for iteration and control flow; Clojure uses `reduce` and keywords for functional programming; Racket uses `for/fold` and `match` for pattern matching and iteration.
- Clojure's syntax is more modern and concise, with vectors and keywords, while Common Lisp retains older Lisp idioms.
- Racket's `#lang` system allows creation of new language variants, making it a powerful tool for language designers and researchers.
