# [How Stripe Built Kai on Deep Agents in 1 Week](https://www.langchain.com/blog/how-stripe-built-their-knowledge-ai-platform-on-deep-agents)

Deep Agents abstracts the 'non-domain' agent infrastructure, allowing engineers to focus on specific business workflows.

## Key Points
- Stripe developed 'Kai', a company-wide productivity agent, utilizing the [[tech/langchain|LangChain]] and [[tech/langgraph|LangGraph]] stack, specifically leveraging the 'Deep Agents' open-source harness.
- The architecture is layered: Deep Agents (base primitives) $\rightarrow$ Stripe-specific harness (security/infra) $\rightarrow$ Configuration layer (custom personas/skills) $\rightarrow$ Kai UI.
- Production-readiness was achieved through three key middleware components: a virtual filesystem (S3-backed) for persistent session context, a sandboxed environment for secure code execution (analytics/PDF processing), and summarization middleware to manage long-turn context limits.
- Kai employs a federated 'skills' model with over 1,000 skills from 100+ teams, using a two-pass dynamic tool loading system to prevent model quality degradation caused by oversized system prompts.
- The project validated Stripe's investment in a Python-native stack, as a single engineer built the initial version in one week using Deep Agents' primitives.
- Adoption grew from ~300 to 5,000+ users in four weeks, with particularly high penetration in non-engineering functions like Marketing (95%) and GTM (87%).
