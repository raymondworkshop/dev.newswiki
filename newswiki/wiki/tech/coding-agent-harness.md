# [Coding Agent Harness](https://x.com/dongxi_nlp/article/2071729771126346093)

The coding agent's true value lies in its runtime system — the harness — which ensures reliability, safety, and consistency in file and workspace operations.

## The Harness Is The Product
- The most critical component of a coding agent is often the 'harness' — the runtime system that manages file state, tool execution, and context — rather than the underlying language model.
- The harness owns the full lifecycle: input routing, message design, prompt assembly, tool validation, permission policy, execution, and state update.
- It acts as a boundary between the model's proposal and real-world effect, ensuring reliability and safety in file and workspace modifications.

## Six Core Responsibilities of a Coding Agent Harness
- Maintain live repo context with accurate workspace, file, and project documentation.
- Enforce structured tool contracts with schema validation, path safety, and permission policies.
- Implement context reduction to prevent information overload and hallucination.
- Maintain transcripts and memory to track what has happened and what is relevant now.
- Enable delegation of tasks to subagents with scoped tools and isolated state for better parallelism and error containment.
- Ensure file truth is preserved by tracking file baselines and detecting stale reads.

## The Stale Read Trap
- A critical bug where the model continues to use outdated file content from a transcript, even after the file has been modified externally.
- The harness must distinguish between transcript text and file truth, and enforce a 'file state' record that reflects the actual disk state.
- When a file is read, the harness must record its baseline (path, hash, timestamp, content) and compare it against the current disk state to detect staleness.

## Tool Contracts as Safety Mechanisms
- Tools are not just functions — they are contracts that define risk, path policies, and execution boundaries.
- Every tool call must undergo validation before approval: path safety, schema compliance, baseline freshness, and human approval when necessary.
- Tool output must be bounded in size and content to prevent context flooding and ensure model reasoning quality.

## Input Routing and Slash Commands
- User input should be routed through an input router that distinguishes between regular work requests and control-plane commands (e.g., /status, /reset, /goal).
- Slash commands (e.g., /goal, /tools, /audit) should be handled locally by the harness to provide runtime diagnostics and session control without involving the model.
- The /goal command is particularly important as it defines a session-level objective that can be paused, resumed, or cleared independently of the model's reasoning.

## Markdown as Context Interface
- AGENTS.md and SKILL.md files provide workspace-specific rules and task procedures, respectively, and should be loaded by the harness at appropriate times to shape behavior.
- AGENTS.md is loaded early to establish workspace-wide rules, while SKILL.md is loaded on-demand to provide task-specific workflows and tool expectations.
- This enables progressive disclosure and prevents the model from being overwhelmed by irrelevant or outdated documentation.

## Context as a Projection
- Context is not a simple append of all past interactions — it is a curated projection of the most relevant and bounded evidence for the current task.
- The harness applies four key projection strategies: large-result preview, idle-gap microcompact, old-span collapse, and auto-compact near the limit.
- This ensures the model receives a clean, focused working set while preserving audit trails and state for debugging and resumption.

## Subagent Architecture and Runtime Management
- A subagent is a child runtime spawned from a parent session, inheriting shared resources like tools and permissions but operating in its own isolated context.
- Subagents can be 'fresh', 'forked', or 'partial forked' depending on the task — with partial forks being most practical for complex workflows.
- The harness must manage subagent lifecycle, including context inheritance, result aggregation, and integration back into the parent session.
