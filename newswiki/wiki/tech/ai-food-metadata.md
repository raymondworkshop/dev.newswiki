# [Building Food Metadata with LLM Juries, Context Optimization & Multimodal AI](https://careersatdoordash.com/blog/building-food-metadata-with-llm-juries-context-optimization-multimodal-ai/)

Multimodal AI systems can achieve high accuracy and scalability when built with automated evaluation and iterative context optimization.

## Key Points
- DoorDash uses a multimodal AI platform to infer item- and store-level attributes from text, images, and web search signals.
- An [[hubs/llm|LLM]] jury system improves annotation accuracy by ~20% compared to human reviewers by enabling consensus-based evaluation of tags.
- Context-optimization agents iteratively improve prompts using failure signals, increasing model precision by over 20% and accelerating development tenfold.
- Distributed computing reduces backfill time from over a month to just days, enabling real-time metadata updates at scale.
- AI-led annotation generates training data with 90% lower inference cost and zero human effort, accelerating fine-tuning of specialized models.

## Technical Innovations
- [[hubs/llm|LLM]] jury system: Multiple [[hubs/llm|LLM]] evaluators independently judge tags and vote on consensus, improving accuracy and reducing human dependency.
- Context optimization loop: Failure signals from high-quality evaluation datasets are used to propose and test prompt improvements, mimicking reinforcement learning.
- Deduplication, Spark distribution, batch processing, and result remapping enable efficient, scalable inference across millions of items.
- AI-generated training data accelerates fine-tuning without requiring human annotation, reducing development cycle time significantly.

## Impact on Customer Experience
- Structured metadata enables powerful downstream features: customer search, personalization, filtering, and analytics.
- Enhanced search and discovery allow users to find relevant dishes based on cuisine, dietary needs, and preferences.
- Metadata serves as a foundational layer for personalization and analytics across the DoorDash platform.
